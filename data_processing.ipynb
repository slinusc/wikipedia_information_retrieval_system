      "        \"text\": \"A Boy's Own Story is a 1982 semi-autobiographical novel by Edmund White. ==Overview== A Boy\\u2019s Own Story is the first of a trilogy of novels, describing a boy's coming of age and documenting a young man's experience of homosexuality in the 1950s in Cincinnati, Chicago and Michigan. The trilogy continued with The Beautiful Room Is Empty (1988) and The Farewell Symphony (1997), which brought the setting up to the 1990s. Although all three share a number of themes and are frequently considered at least partly autobiographical, they do not tell a linear story in the manner of some trilogies, and can be read independently of one another. == Plot == The story starts when the narrator, aged 15, experiences the physical side of young love with his twelve-year-old friend Kevin O'Brien. Although he is the younger boy, Kevin takes the lead in the sexual activity. The encounters between the two adolescents become infrequent and are pushed to the background as the narrator's soul-searching about his homosexuality continues. The narrator remembers his childhood and his parents' divorce, as well as his older sister's constant teasing. Since a young age, he knew he was attracted to men, but he tried to outgrow it or rationalize it as some kind of passing phase. During a visit to his father over the summer, the protagonist befriends a man from the town that promises to take him to New York for some money. The man never appears on the day that they were going to leave, so the protagonist understands that he was tricked. The next time he meets him, however, the man takes him to a hustler, with whom the protagonist has his first sexual experience. During a camping trip to which he arrives earlier than the rest of the boys, he gives oral sex to a troubled boy that everyone else avoided. After experiencing an unrequited crush on his best friend, the protagonist asks his father to be sent to a male boarding school, convinced that the constant interactions with men would help him leave his homosexuality behind. He also starts seeing a therapist, who tries to convince him that his homosexuality is caused by his attachment to his mother. The protagonist befriends one of his teachers and his wife, with whom he discusses literature and philosophy. He learns that his teacher was also gay, but he declares that his wife and God helped him leave that phase behind. Eventually, a jazz teacher arrives and the protagonist learns that he was selling marihuana, so he decides to tell on him. Before doing that, however, he seduces the jazz teacher and gives him oral sex. The teacher gets fired, and the protagonist tries to rationalize his actions by telling himself that he just wanted to use his teacher but did not want to commit to his homosexuality. ==Literary significance and criticism== Catherine Stimpson, a reviewer, suggests that A Boy's Own Story combines elements of J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Oscar Wilde's De Profundis.Catherine Stimpson, 'The Bodies and Souls of American Men', The New York Times, October 10, 1982 Paul Flynn and Matthew Todd call the novel \\\"a touchstone in gay culture just as Christopher Isherwood\\u2019s Goodbye to Berlin was in the 30s, Larry Kramer\\u2019s Faggots in the 70s\\\". ==References== ==External links== *New York Times review Category:Fiction set in the 1950s Category:1982 American novels Category:American autobiographical novels Category:Novels by Edmund White Category:Novels set in New Jersey Category:Novels with gay themes Category:E.

      "        \"text\": \"A Boy's Will is a poetry collection by Robert Frost, and is the poet's first commercially published book of poems. The book was first published in 1913 by David Nutt in London, with a dedication to Frost's wife, Elinor. Its first American edition would come two years later, in 1915, through Henry Holt and Company. Like much of Frost's work, the poems in A Boy's Will thematically associate with rural life, nature, philosophy, and individuality, while also alluding to earlier poets including Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, William Shakespeare, and William Wordsworth.Fagan, Deirdre. 2007. Critical Companion to Robert Frost: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work. New York: Facts on File . Despite the first section of poems having a theme of retreating from society, then, Frost does not retreat from his literary precursors and, instead, tries to find his place among them.Richardson, Mark. The Ordeal of Robert Frost: The Poet and His Poetics. University of Illinois Press, 1997: 105\\u2013106. ==Background== Frost admitted that much of the book is autobiographical. As the proof sheets were printed in January 1913, he wrote that the poems were \\\"pretty near being the story of five years\\\" of his life. Specifically, Frost noted that the first poem of the book, \\\"Into My Own\\\", expresses how he turned away from people, and \\\"Tuft of Flowers\\\" shows how he \\\"came back to them.\\\" In fact, some of the poems were written as early as two decades before.Kendall, Tim. 2012. The Art of Robert Frost. Yale University Press.. . Frost was apparently pleased with the book and wrote to a friend shortly after its publication, \\\"I expect to do something to the present state of literature in America.\\\"Kilcup, Karen L. 1998. Robert Frost and Feminine Literary Tradition. University of Michigan Press. p. 89. The title of the book comes from the repeated lines in the poem \\\"My Lost Youth\\\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:Parini, Jay. 1999. Robert Frost: A Life. New York: Henry Holt and Company, LLC. . The line is, in turn, a quote from Olaus Sirma in Lapponia (1675).Hatfield, James Taft. \\\"Longfellow's Lappland Song\\\" in PMLA. Vol. 45, No. 4 (December 1930): 1188\\u20131192 Frost likely chose the title as a reflection of his own wayward early life. ==Publication history and response== thumb|Robert Frost in 1913 Most of the poems in A Boy's Will had never been published previously. While in England, Frost determined to have them collected, and his manuscript was accepted by the first publisher he approached. The book was published by David Nutt of London in 1913, with a dedication to Frost's wife Elinor, who had assisted in choosing the poems and arranging the order for publication. As it was being published, Frost met with fellow writer Ezra Pound, who insisted they immediately go to Nutt to see a copy of the book in print. Pound offered to write a review that day and soon introduced Frost to poet William Butler Yeats. Yeats said he considered A Boy's Will \\\"the best poetry written in America in a long time.\\\"Shuman, R. Baird Great American Writers: Twentieth Century. Marshall Cavendish, In his September 1913 review in the New Freeman, Pound noted: \\\"The man has the good sense to speak naturally and to paint the thing, the thing as he sees it. And to do this is a very different matter from gunning about for the circumplectious polysyllable.\\\"Hoffman, Tyler. 2001. Robert Frost and the Politics of Poetry. Hanover, NH: Middlebury College Press. . F. S. Flint was particularly pleased with the individual poems using one specific theme each, allowing \\\"direct observation of the object and immediate correlation with the emotion\\u2014spontaneity, subtlety in the evocation of moods, humor\\\" and praised Frost's \\\"ear for silences.\\\" Poet Richard Aldington would similarly praise Frost's \\\"directness of treatment\\\" and \\\"simplicity of speech\\\" in North of Boston. Lascelles Abercrombie, however, warned that the simplicity of Frost's language did not imply simplicity in his poetry and in A Boy's Will, he believed \\\"the selection and arrangement of the substance do practically everything.\\\" William Morton Payne also noted there was further complexity within the seeming simplicity of the book, writing for The Dial in 1913, \\\"A dream world of elusive shapes and tremulous imaginings is half revealed to our vision by the subdued lyrics which Mr. Robert Frost entitles 'A Boy's Will'.\\\"Diepeveen, Leonard. 2003. The Difficulties of Modernism. New York: Routledge. p. 186. The youth of the author, however, was apparent to at least one anonymous critic who wrote in a September 20, 1913, review, \\\"We do not need to be told that the poet is a young man: the dew and the ecstasy \\u2014 the audacity, too \\u2014 of pristine vision are here.\\\" Overall, the book (or collection as some may call it) was widely well-received and positively reviewed. Following the success of North of Boston in 1914, Henry Holt and Company republished A Boy's Will in 1915, becoming the first edition of the book published in the United States. The New York Times said in a review, \\\"In republishing his first book after his second, Mr. Robert Frost has undertaken the difficult task of competing with himself.\\\"\\\"'A Boy's Will'.

      "        \"text\": \"A Boyar Wedding Feast was painted in 1883 by Russian artist Konstantin Makovsky (1839\\u20131915). The painting shows a toast at a wedding feast following a boyar marriage, where the bride and the groom are expected to kiss each other. The bride looks sad and reluctant, while the elderly attendant standing behind her encourages the bride to kiss the groom. The work won a gold medal at the World's Fair held in Antwerp, Belgium in 1885, and is considered to be one of Makovsky's most popular works. It is currently located in Hillwood museum, Washington DC, US. == Background == thumb|Makovsky's self portrait (1856) Konstantin Makovsky (1839-1915) was a famous Russian realist painter who opposed academic restrictions that existed in the art world at the time. His father was the Russian art figure and amateur painter, Egor Makovsky and his mother was a composer. Because of his parents' professions, Makovsky showed an early interest in painting and music. He entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture at the age of 12, where he was influenced by teachers such as Vasily Tropinin and Karl Bryullov. After graduating, Makovsky went to France in hopes of becoming a composer, but after touring Europe in order to get acquainted with traditional folk and classical music, he ultimately chose painting. In 1858 Makovsky entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, where he created artworks such as Curing of the Blind (1860) and Agents of the False Dmitry kill the son of Boris Godunov (1862). In 1863, Makovsky and thirteen other students protested against the Academy's decision to only allow artwork of Scandinavian mythology in the competition for the Large Gold Medal of Academia. Thus, all of them left the academy without a diploma. This incident later came to be known as the \\\"Revolt of the Fourteen\\\". Later, Makovsky joined the Artel of Artists, a cooperative association founded by Ivan Kramskoi, whose members were realist artists that advocated for more realistic depictions of the everyday life of old Russia. Notable works by Makovsky of this period are \\\"The Widow\\\" (1865) and \\\"The Herringwoman\\\" (1867). In 1870 he became a founding member of the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions and continued to work on paintings in the realism genre. He went on to travel North Africa and Serbia in the mid-1870s., which resulted in a significant stylistic change as he started putting greater emphasis on colours and shapes. At the World's Fair of 1889 in Paris, he received the Large Gold Medal for his paintings Death of Ivan the Terrible, The Judgement of Paris, and Demon and Tamara. By the end of the century, Makovsky was one of the most respected and highly-paid Russian artists, regarded by some critics as the forerunner of Russian impressionism. He died in 1915 when his crew crashed into a tram on the streets of St. Petersburg. ==Painting== A Boyar Wedding Feast is an oil on canvas painting measuring , set in either the 16th or 17th century, in which a room of guests are depicted toasting a newlywed couple. A traditionally offered boyar wedding toast is meant to encourage the first kiss to make the wine sweeter. The couple stands at the head of the table (right), where the groom presents his bride to the wedding guests and sees her without her veil for the first time. She appears timid and bashful as the men toast for the first kiss. To the right of the couple, the \\\"Lady of Ceremony\\\" gently urges on the bride. thumb|200px|left|Detail: the roasted swan on a large platter Makovsky's depiction of the wedding, an important social event of 16th and 17th century boyar life, is dramatically lit. The guests are depicted at the table with food and drink served on silverware in front of them. A roasted swan is being brought in on a large platter, the last dish served before the couple retire into the bedroom. Luxurious details such as silver cups, richly embroidered garments, and an ivory chest with a silver bowl in the foreground are depicted. The bride and the other women are wearing pearl-studded kokoshniki, a Russian woman's headdress. ==Provenance== Winning the 1885 medal of honor at the Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (2 May \\u2013 2 November 1885), A Boyar Wedding Feast was purchased by American jeweler and art collector Charles William Schumann in August 1885 for $15,000 (or \\u00a310,000). Schumann reportedly outbid Alexander III of Russia to obtain the work. The painting was auctioned as part of Schumann's estate on 23 January 1936 and sold for $2,500. Sometime after the sale, A Boyar Wedding Feast entered the collection of Robert Ripley, creator of Ripley's Believe It or Not!. It was sold during his estate sale on 26 August 1949 for $2,200. The painting was again offered for sale on 18 December 1968. Between 1968 and 1973, the painting was acquired by Marjorie Merriweather Post. Upon her death in 1973, the Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens was founded by Post's estate, and A Boyar Wedding Feast was donated to the collection. ==See also== * Decorating of the Bride ==References== Notes Citations Bibliography * * * * * * * * * ==External links== :* La Belle Epoque en Europe Category:1883 paintings Category:Food and drink paintings Category:Paintings by Konstantin Makovsky Category:History paintings Category:Paintings of people Category:Paintings in Washington, D.C.

Twenty years later, Holly is a romantic skeptic and is more focused on her career as a social worker. At the time, she is in court helping a mother get her children back from foster care. When the mother's lawyer, Ryan Hughes, does not show up in court, Holly is extremely angry and sends Hughes a letter via her secretary. On Christmas Day, she opens her door to a man carrying a Christmas tree and a bow on his chest. He hands her a note that says, \\\"As promised, one boyfriend for Christmas,\\\" and introduces himself as \\\"Douglas Firwood\\\".The name is a pun on Douglas fir, a species of evergreen tree that is commonly used as a Christmas tree. She assumes he is a gag present from her friend Diane, and invites him into her home. Later that day she takes him with her to her parents' house for Christmas dinner. Hoping to keep her matchmaking family, especially her manipulative sister-in-law Carol, off her back, she tells everyone that Douglas is her long-term boyfriend, and Douglas plays along. On New Year's Eve, Holly learns from her scheming ex-boyfriend Ted that Douglas is really Ryan Hughes, who was sent to her by Santa Claus. She accuses him of lying to her and tells him to leave. After persuasion by Santa Claus and refusing Ted's marriage proposal, she follows Ryan. They meet up at a park, where they finally remember where they first met - at age 13 when she helped him take his little sister to see Santa - and they watch the New Year's fireworks together. ==Cast== * Kelli Williams as Holly Grant * Patrick Muldoon as Ryan Hughes/Douglas Firwood * Charles Durning as Santa Claus * Bruce Thomas as Ted *Shannon Wilcox as Joanna Grant * Martin Mull as Martin Grant *Bridget White as Carol Grant * David Starzyk as Ian Grant * Jordan Orr as Noah Grant * Shane Baumel as Neal Grant * Erica Gimpel as Beth * Maeve Quinlan as Diane *John Dybdahl as Stu *Kenneth Danziger as Harrison Lane * Rodger Bumpass as Russell Parker * Laura Kirk as Sheila Denning * Kelli King as young Holly Grant *Brent Toney as Philip ==Release== ===Television=== A Boyfriend for Christmas was a made-for-TV production, which aired on the Hallmark Channel November 27, 2004.
